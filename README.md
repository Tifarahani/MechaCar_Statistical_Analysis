## MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

#### Overview:
AutosRUs is developing a new prototype vehicle, MechaCar. MechaCar is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this project the team will:
Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers
Designed a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers
